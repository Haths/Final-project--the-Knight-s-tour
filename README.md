# Final-project--the-Knight-s-tour
A [knight's tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once.

>The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students.[1] Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 × 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

### According to [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour), here is a theory about existence of a Knight's Tour
>1. Schwenk proved that for any m × n board with m ≤ n, a closed knight's tour is always possible unless one or more of these three conditions are met:
  >>* m and n are both odd
  >>* m = 1, 2, or 4
  >>* m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8.
>2. Cull et al. and Conrad et al. proved that on any rectangular board whose smaller dimension is at least 5, there is a (possibly open) knight's tour.
